This is the assigned password matching delete solution. Type a password you assigned to a file, and it will be deleted.<br>
Files without a delete password cannot be deleted with this method.<br><br>

<div id="filelist"></div><br>
These delete buttons were my original solution. They are inserted with JS and delete any file without authentication.
